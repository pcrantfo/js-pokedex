# js-pokedex
 
*Project Overview*
This app displays a list of pokemon in order up to #150. Each pokemon entry can be clicked to display further information.

Users can access more pokemon by changing the apiURL variable. '?limit=151' sets the Pokedex API (https://pokedex.org/) access limit to the first 151 pokemon. Accessing too many is not recommended, however. It may crash the server.

Simply download the files and ope the index.html file in a browser. Alternatively, the app is live at pcrantfo.github.io/js-pokedex

*Project dependencies*
This app uses HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6. It also includes links to two polyfills protecting functionality of fetches and promises.
